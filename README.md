# RandomProjects
A repository for all the random programs I've written that don't belong anywhere else

## Battleship

A game I created in C++ that is similar to the classic game. I changed some of the ship names to more modern stuff, like a SHIELD helicarrier.

## DiffEquProject

A project I did in Differential Equations that focused on finding an equation to model the movement of a mousetrap car

## Rotation Python

A program I made to implement a rotation of an equation inputted through Python's eval function. The program utilizes rudimentary linear algebra techniques to describe the rotation and compute the ending animation.

## Alexa Meme Script

Inspired by Neil Deshmukh (QuantumTCode). A Python script that takes in voice input (from computer microphones) and determines if the words are "Alexa, this is so sad". Implemented via taking my own voice sample, normalizing it, and comparing it withing a certain range of the input. If it is determined to be close enough, the script then plays a parody version of Despacito. I will later try and add ML to determine the voice input accuracy better.
