# RandomProjects
A repository for all the random programs I've written that don't belong anywhere else

## Battleship

A game I created in C++ that is similar to the classic game. I changed some of the ship names to more modern stuff, like a SHIELD helicarrier.

## DiffEquProject

A project I did in Differential Equations that focused on finding an equation to model the movement of a mousetrap car

## Rotation Python

A program I made to implement a rotation of an equation inputted through Python's eval function. The program utilizes rudimentary linear algebra techniques to describe the rotation and compute the ending animation.
